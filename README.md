# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
Hello my name is Ethan White. I graduated from the University of Washington with a B.S in Biochemistry in June 2020. Since graduating I began with years working in wet lab jobs requiring strong multitasking and attention to detail. Over time working in these jobs my interest in the data and results being generated by my experiments has grown. A majority of my work experience with data was with Excel, Google Suite, and more recently Python. As my interest in Data Analysis grew I began education at home through Coursera completing the IBM Data Analyst Certification in April 2023. Simultaneously I requested more challenging data projects at work at the Altius Institute for Biomedical Research in my position as a Data Imaging Research Associate 3. All of this year has been spent upskilling and immersing myself further in the world of Data Analytics. My projects below highlight diffrent skills I've acquired and practiced during this time along side projects I've contributed to in my current role at Altius.
